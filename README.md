### Additional Considerations
- **Custom Error Messages:** If a user tries to access a link that doesn’t exist, you might want to display a friendly error message directing them back to the home page or a support page.
  
- **Contact Information:** Including a contact link in each message can help users reach out for assistance or clarification.

- **Support Hours:** If relevant, consider adding your support hours or a response time estimate to manage user expectations.

Feel free to adapt these messages to better fit your brand's voice!
